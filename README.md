## Description
The aim of this was to build a work portfolio, showing potential employers samples of the application I have worked on.

### Problems Solved

* I started with building a wireframe using HTML and CSS.

* I also added my reset.css sheet to the directory.

* I then worked on each section of the HTML together with the CSS file.

* I inserted the link element <a> and image element <img> together in the  HTML.

* Also added psuedo elements and selector elements in the CSS file.

* Also made the web application responsive by changing the flex wrap and flex direction at a max width to accomodate several media screens.

* My biggest challenge was working with CSS to get the right sizes of boxes for each section but eventually I'll get better.
